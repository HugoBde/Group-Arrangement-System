## Help
# How to run this project?
In order to run the current project, you will need to have Node.js and its package manager (NPM) installed on your device. We will be using the latest Long-Term Support version (LTS): version 16.X.
Node.js can be installed from this link [here](https://nodejs.org/en). (NPM should be included, but if it isn't let me know so I can edit those instructions)

Next, you will need Git or the GitHub GUI Client to clone this repository on your machine. I am not familiar with the GitHub GUI Client you can figure that one out yourself. Git is available to download [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once everything is installed, open a terminal and clone the repository wherever you want by running
```
git@github.com:HugoBde/Group-Arrangement-System.git
```
You will need to have an SSH key linked to your GitHub account, let me know if you need help setting that up.

Once done, enter the repository's folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies for the project.

Finally, simply run `npm run dev` to build and run the project. If you haven't made any changes you can simply run `npm run start` to skip the building step.
